# Project 2: Analyze NYSE Data

## Introduction
In this project, you will go through the process of calculating summary statistics, drawing an inference from the statistics, calculating business metrics and using models to forecast future growth prospects for the companies. The goal is for you to perform an analysis and also create visual tools to communicate the results in informative ways.

### What skills will I use?

The main goal of this project is for you to demonstrate your ability to:\
interpret the measures of central tendency and spread (mean, median, standard deviation, range)\
use a combination of Excel or Google Sheets functions (e.g., IF statements, INDEX and MATCH, calculating descriptive statistics with the IF statement, drop downs, data validation, VLOOKUP).\
analyze and forecast financial business metrics using Excel or Google Sheets.\
create visualizations of a business metric and use Excel or Google Sheets to create a financial forecast model.

### Final project

For the final project, you will conduct three tasks:
1) complete your own data analysis and create a presentation to share your findings,
2) develop a dashboard for a Profit and Loss Statement,
3) create a Financial Forecasting Model using three scenarios.

#### Submission
Put your presentation and spreadsheet workbook you used to do the analysis in a folder and zip it. Then submit the zipped folder for your project.
