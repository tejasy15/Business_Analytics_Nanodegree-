# Query a Digital Music Store Database

## Introduction
In this project, you will query the Chinook Database. The Chinook Database holds information about a music store. For this project, you will be assisting the Chinook team with understanding the media in their store, their customers and employees, and their invoice information.

## Description
You have the ability to be creative in the questions you ask. You will then write a SQL query to pull the data needed to successfully answer your question. Use the pulled data to build a visual (bar chart, histogram, or another plot) that answers your question.\

#### Queries
Please include a text file that includes each of the queries used to create the visualizations. You should format your queries for readability. In a plain text file.
The questions you ask are up to you, and all four of your final submitted queries should contain a JOIN and AGGREGATION. 

#### Visualization
We suggest you use a spreadsheet application, such as Excel or Google Sheets to create your visualizations. However, you’re welcome to use whatever tool you’d like. Your visualizations could be any that you learned about in the previous lesson. 

Put your text file and presentation in a folder and zip it. Then submit the zipped folder for your project.
